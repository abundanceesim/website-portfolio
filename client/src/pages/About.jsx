        Hi, I'm Abundance, a software developer and recent Computer Programming
        graduate. I'm Nigerian but currently reside in Canada. 
        I have experience building web applications, particularly using JavaScript,
        Angular and React.

      When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you'll likely find me exploring
      new art mediums, either digitally or traditionally. I also really enjoy playing
      video games, particularly Apex Legends. I firmly believe in the power of work-life balance, and
      these pursuits keep me energized and inspired.
